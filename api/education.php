<p>My primary interest is computer science education. Since June of 2025, I do research, advised by Professor Michael Shindler, about active learning, student experiences, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. I frequently collaborate with Julia Nguyen. I apply my knowledge as a tutor for the School of ICS, as the head learning assistant for the discrete math series, and as a peer. I intend to continue in computer science education as a PhD student.</p>
<p>In the area of math, I am most interested in algebra and discrete math. I have completed the undergraduate series in calculus and algebra, and I am currently taking the linear algebra and analysis series. I look forward to studying topology, geometry, and number theory.</p>
<p>In the area of computer science, I am interested in operating systems, theory of computation and (FOSS) programming. I have worked in Assembly, C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python (Numpy, Pyplot, Scikit-learn), and Matlab. You can find my reviews of math and CS classes at UCI <a href="https://github.com/decaquestionmarks/The-New-UCI-ICS-Discord-Class-Opinions" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I participated in speech and debate from 5th to 12th grade. In high school, I focused on policy effects and issues linked to capitalism, with Leo Hsu. I was president of the debate club for two years and participated in national-circuit policy tournaments with the Sacramento Urban Debate League.</p>
<p>I learned Spanish in high school and am currently learning Vietnamese. In my free time, I study physics, epistemology, critical queer theory, and moral psychology, and I play the piano.</p>
