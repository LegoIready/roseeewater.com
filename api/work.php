<h1>Work</h1>
<h2>Employment</h2>
<p>Since Fall 2025, I am a drop-in tutor at the Information and Computer Sciences Tutoring Center at UC Irvine, for $22.15/hr, with a team of about ten people. I am responsible for tutoring students in lower-division Assembly, C, C++, Python, data structures, boolean logic and discrete structures, discrete mathematics, statistics, computer architecture, and operating systems. I am also responsible for tracking which students I tutor and for how long, for purposes of securing funding for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>Since Summer 2025, I am an undergraduate research assistant for Professor Michael Shindler at UCI, with some time volunteered and some time compensated with academic credits, with a team of about 15 people, including graduate students and undergraduate students. I am responsible, with Julia Nguyen, for leading a study on student experiences and persistence. I also contribute to studies on active learning.</p>
<p>In Spring 2024, I was a learning assistant for boolean logic and discrete structures taught by Professor Irene Gassko at UCI, with time compensated with academic credits, with a team of about 20 people, including graduate student TAs, undergraduate graders, and undergraduate learning assistants. In Winter 2025 and Winter 2026, I was the lead learning assistant for discrete mathematics taught by Professor Gassko, with teams of similar size but without graders in 2026. For these courses, I was responsible for supporting around 300 students each term in flipped-classroom activities, hosting weekly study hall sessions, meeting weekly to discuss the course content and structure, and proctoring exams. As a lead, I hosted some of our weekly meetings.</p>
